# ModBaseMaker
A Tool For Creating Mods Fast. Creates A Mod Template With Your Name And Your Chosen Mod Name That Is Heavily Modular. Extremely Useful.

The Generated Mod Will Automatically Build To Your Mods Folder, Have All References (Lazy, I Know) & Have PlagueButtonAPI Auto-Referenced. It Also Has My Custom Modular Code-Base. Enjoy!
